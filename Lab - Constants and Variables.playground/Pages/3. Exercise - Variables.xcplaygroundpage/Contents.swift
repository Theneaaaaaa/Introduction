 ## Exercise - Variables
 
 Declare a variable `schooling` and set it to the number of years of school that you have completed. Print `schooling` to the console.
 */
var schooling = 15
print(schooling)
/*:
 Now imagine you just completed an additional year of school, and update the `schooling` variable accordingly. Print `schooling` to the console.
 */
schooling = 16
print(schooling)
/*:
 Does the above code compile? Why is this different than trying to update a constant? Print your explanation to the console using the `print` function.
 */
print("it worked. It is different because it is a variable already, so it doesn't have to be a new variable.")
print(schooling)
